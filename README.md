## <a name="whatibring">What I bring</a>
### My Philosophy üå±

- I believe life should be kept interesting, and pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone is a great way to do that, doing a variety of things.

- Companies are really nothing more than the people that work for them. So treat them well, understand them and how they work. Maintain a good culture, offer interesting work, and the chance to grow. 

- I love (indeed, thrive on) being thrown in at the deep end. 

- Effective leadership is leading from the front, and emotionally intelligent team-working is the best, for both people and task.

### Tech stack I've covered so far ü§ñ
- **Languages & Frameworks:** JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, Sinatra, TypeScript, WebSocket
- **Databases:** MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Testing:** Jest, Cypress, RSpec
- **Mobile:** React Native

### My personal skills üí•
- Clarity. I'm good at explaining things clearly and with no nonsense. 
- Quick on the uptake. Working out what's needed, doing the right amount of work, with the right tool, to the deadline.
- Insanely fast reader, with a thirst for knowledge.
- I'm thorough, and I never give up.
