## <a name="me">About me</a>

Former company founder turned software developer. Recent graduate from Makers Academy, with a diverse background of 5 years in the corporate sector (analytics & product management) & 6 years with a start-up (co-founder). I moved into coding because I want to work around intelligent people, enjoy being able to see the results of my work, and get to constantly learn new things in a cutting-edge industry.

## <a name="whatibring">What I bring</a>
### My Philosophy üå±

- I believe life should be kept interesting, and pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone is a great way to do that, doing a variety of things.

- Companies are really nothing more than the people that work for them. So treat them well, understand them and how they work. Maintain a good culture, offer interesting work, and the chance to grow. 

- I love (indeed, thrive on) being thrown in at the deep end. 

- Effective leadership is leading from the front, and emotionally intelligent team-working is the best, for both people and task.

### Tech stack I've covered so far ü§ñ
- **Languages & Frameworks:** JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, Sinatra, TypeScript, WebSocket
- **Databases:** MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Testing:** Jest, Cypress, RSpec
- **Mobile:** React Native

### My personal skills üí•
- Clarity. I'm good at explaining things clearly and with no nonsense. 
- Quick on the uptake. Working out what's needed, doing the right amount of work, with the right tool, to the deadline.
- Insanely fast reader, with a thirst for knowledge.
- I'm thorough, and I never give up.

#### Co-Founder 

*Design and sustainable furniture brand, creating products for the circular economy using novel, tech-enabled on-demand manufacturing. - grain.co.uk* *

- Co-founded with a friend in 2016. Leadership of operations, technology, product & research. I built and nurtured a culture of supportive teamwork & empathy, to empower us as a people-first business.

- Over 6 years, from self-funded with a ¬£50k start-up loan, grew to ¬£1 million+ annual revenue, raised ¬£1.1million in venture capital at ¬£5 million valuation, and built the team to 15 full-time employees. Launched and ran E-commerce brand with a return on advertising spend of >4:1 (very strong in this space).

- Attended the highly competitive accelerator program Founders Factory in 2020.

- Built a 3D product configurator/visualiser for our website using React/Redux, Playcanvas, and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) + Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) software allowing live customisation by users. We applied a strong customer focus to UX/UI design.

- Worked closely with manufacturers to increase efficiency using bespoked CAD & management software, reducing our costs by >15%, which they have since adopted across all clients. 

- Proud to have been a design-led company, with a brilliant team following strong, research-based internal processes. Sadly, we didn‚Äôt survive the cost of living crisis - * *please note that digital assets were sold off and don‚Äôt fully represent the original 2016-2022 mission.*

#### Product Manager

*California headquartered catastrophe modelling software firm, providing damage assessments from natural catastrophes via licensable software to reinsurance companies, the finance sector, and governments.*

- Product management team for natural hazard models. Ensured model releases were cutting edge, robust, and market-accepted.¬†Defined requirements, worked with model scientists & developers, and undertook validation & client acceptance testing involving huge attention to detail.

- Ran European model testing, creating new software processes using SQL & VBA to automate model update testing/reporting, cutting 66% from teams‚Äô workload and removing human errors.

- Following promotion, sole responsibility for the companies‚Äô global probabilistic terrorism model. >95% acceptance of model updates during my tenure was down to working closely with clients, including authoring usable documentation, and giving international conference presentations to audiences > 50.

- Cross-team and multi-national project leadership with developers in California and New Delhi, and clients in Zurich, gave me serious insight into managing different perspectives. 



## <a name="education">Education</a>

### Makers Academy (Sept 22 - Jan 23)
* 4 month highly selective full-time course for career changers to become software developers.

* Included 6 weeks of Agile team working projects, embodying extreme programming (XP) values, pair programming, full git workflow, and code reviews requiring high attention to detail.

* Strong emphasis on empathetic team-work, using test-driven-development (TDD) and debugging processes in Ruby and JavaScript, to write error-proof code. 

* Projects included; full-stack web application, e.g using MERN (Mongo-Express-React-Node), Object Oriented Programming with SOLID principles, Model-View-Controller (MVC) patterns, cloud deployment, external API‚Äôs, unit and integration testing, and creating high-quality, readable, documented code.

* Self-led learning with a growth mindset has given me the ability to quickly and effectively take on new frameworks & languages, and tackle pre-existing, complex codebases.
