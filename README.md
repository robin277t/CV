## <a name="me">About me</a>

Former company founder turned software developer. Recent graduate from Makers Academy, with a diverse background of 5 years in the corporate sector (analytics & product management) & 6 years with a start-up (co-founder). I moved into coding because I want to work around intelligent people, enjoy being able to see the results of my work, and get to constantly learn new things in a cutting-edge industry.

## <a name="whatibring">What I bring</a>
### My Philosophy 🌱

- I believe life should be kept interesting, and pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone is a great way to do that, doing a variety of things.

- Companies are really nothing more than the people that work for them. So treat them well, understand them and how they work. Maintain a good culture, offer interesting work, and the chance to grow. 

- I love (indeed, thrive on) being thrown in at the deep end. 

- Effective leadership is leading from the front, and emotionally intelligent team-working is the best, for both people and task.

### Tech stack I've covered so far 🤖
- **Languages & Frameworks:** JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, Sinatra, TypeScript, WebSocket
- **Databases:** MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Testing:** Jest, Cypress, RSpec
- **Mobile:** React Native

### My personal skills 💥
- **Clarity.**
I'm good at communicating things clearly and with no nonsense. I developed this skill in 2 places, firstly by giving presentations on natural catastrophes, where it is easy to try and impress with science, but understanding what the audience actually needs to hear is important for keeping their attention. Secondly was when running a business (often being squeezed for time), where giving unambiguous & clear instructions was really important to avoid errors that could multiply down the line. My clarity was also amply demonstated when managing Trello tickets and breaking up workload during team projects at Makers Academy. I'm not afraid to speak up when needed.

- **Inquisitive**
I am a fast reader, and learner, with a decent thirst for knowledge. I've just enjoyed watching/reading a crash course on computer science to understand how it all works under the hood. In my work life this is also a useful trait, whether it's being able to quickly take in journal articles from the latest weather forecasting science, or comprehending legal contracts whilst at Grain. At Makers, this skill proved invaluable to getting team projects up and running in quick time, particularly when we were required to understand and start using new frameworks or codebases from their documentation.

- **Working well under pressure**
Pitching and negotiating, whilst simultaneously keeping the day-to-day functions of my company running made for a high-pressure environment. This would often bring out the most productive side of me, with a mind focussed on efficiency. Similarly, I found in my previous corporate role, working in a client driven environment, that I enjoyed the busy times the most. During the Makers program, I/we often set outselves ambitious goals in order to maximise the time we had there, which required working well under pressure as deadlines approached, so as to keep the project structured. I have good stamina for keeping going, whilst remaining thorough. However, I am also self-aware enough to know when something is too much for me or those around me, and to raise that.

- **Quick on the uptake, thinking several steps ahead.**
Working out what's needed, doing the right amount of work, with the right tool, to the deadline. I found this to be a massively important skill working at my start-up, where we had limited resources and time, and a plethora of competing tools we could use, with potentially high stakes for getting the choice wrong. Analysing an action from start to end before beginning work, such as when choosing a type of manufacturing process to produce a new product, or to bolt on a new service to our website was crucial to success. New things needed to be learnt quickly, or for quickly learnable alternatives to be found in order to stay on-mission and complete the task well. I have found these skills to be highly applicable when working on coding projects, especially at planning/inception stages and during retros.

## <a name="experience">Experience</a>

### Grain, 2016 - 2022, London
#### Co-Founder 

*Design and sustainable furniture brand, creating products for the circular economy using novel, tech-enabled on-demand manufacturing. - grain.co.uk* *

- Co-founded with a friend in 2016. Leadership of operations, technology, product & research. I built and nurtured a culture of supportive teamwork & empathy, to empower us as a people-first business.

- Over 6 years, from self-funded with a £50k start-up loan, grew to £1 million+ annual revenue, raised £1.1million in venture capital at £5 million valuation, and built the team to 15 full-time employees. Launched and ran E-commerce brand with a return on advertising spend of >4:1 (very strong in this space).

- Attended the highly competitive accelerator program [Founders Factory](https://foundersfactory.com/)in 2020, working with some seriously seasoned professional advisors, and commencing our investment journey.

- Built a 3D product configurator/visualiser for our website using React/Redux, Playcanvas, and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) + Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) software allowing live customisation by users. We applied a strong customer focus to UX/UI design.

- Worked closely with manufacturers to increase efficiency using bespoked CAD & management software, reducing our costs by >15%, which they have since adopted across all clients. 

- Proud to have been a design-led company, with a brilliant team following strong, research-based internal processes. Sadly, we didn’t survive the cost of living crisis - * *please note that digital assets were sold off and don’t fully represent the original 2016-2022 mission.*

#### Product Manager

*California headquartered catastrophe modelling software firm, providing damage assessments from natural catastrophes via licensable software to reinsurance companies, the finance sector, and governments.*

- Product management team for natural hazard models. Ensured model releases were cutting edge, robust, and market-accepted. Defined requirements, communicated appropriately with model scientists & developers, and undertook validation & client acceptance testing involving huge attention to detail.

- Ran European model testing, creating new software processes using SQL & VBA to automate model update testing/reporting, cutting 66% from teams’ workload and removing human errors.

- Following promotion, sole responsibility for the companies’ global probabilistic terrorism model. >95% acceptance of model updates during my tenure was down to working closely with clients and clarity of communications, including authoring usable documentation and giving international conference presentations to audiences > 50.

- Cross-team and multi-national project leadership with developers in California and New Delhi, and clients in Zurich, gave me serious insight into managing different perspectives.
