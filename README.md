Skills - tech stack and soft



## <a name="experience">Experience</a>




Grain - Co-Founder 2016 - 2022 - London
grain.co.uk - Design and sustainable furniture brand, creating products for the circular economy using novel, tech-enabled on-demand manufacturing.

Co-founded with a friend in 2016. Ran operations, technology, product and research. **

Over 6 years, from self-funded with a £50k start-up loan, grew to £1 million+ annual revenue, raised £1.1million in venture capital at £5 million valuation, and built the team to 15 full-time employees. Launched and ran E-commerce brand with a return on advertising spend of >4:1 (very strong in this space)

Attended highly-selective accelerator program Founders Factory in 2020.

Built a 3D product configurator/visualiser for our website using React/Redux, Playcanvas, and CAD/CGI software allowing live customisation by users. Included significant UX and UI design R&D.

Worked closely with manufacturers to increase efficiency using bespoked CAD & management software, reducing our costs by >15%, which they have since adopted across all clients.



Proud to have been a design-led company with very strong, research-based internal processes. Sadly, we didn’t survive the cost of living crisis - please note that digital assets were sold off and don’t fully represent the original 2016-2022 mission.

Risk Management Solutions - Product Manager 2010 - 2015 - London
California headquartered catastrophe modelling software firm, providing damage assessments from natural catastrophes via licensable software to reinsurance companies, the finance sector, and governments.

Product management team for natural hazard models. Goal was ensuring model releases that were cutting edge, robust, and market-accepted.  Defined requirements, worked with model scientists & developers, and undertook validation & client acceptance testing.

Initially ran European model testing, and following promotion, full responsibility for the companies’ global probabilistic terrorism model.

Created a new software-driven process using SQL and VBA to automate model update testing and reporting, cutting 50% off the running time and removing human errors. 

>95% client acceptance of model updates during my tenure, from working together closely and understanding their needs. Included authoring technical but understandable documentation, and international conference presentations to audiences > 50.

Cross-team and multi-national project management with developers in California and New Delhi, and clients in Zurich, gave me serious insight into managing different perspectives.

All things cycling, big fan of yoga, episodic runner. Voracious reader, and a highly trained but occasional cellist. Hiking and anything that gets me into the outdoors brings me joy.
